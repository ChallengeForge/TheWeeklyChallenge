                Outreachy provides internships in open source and open science. Outreachy provides internships to
                people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where
                they are living.

                <p>
                    Are you new to the free software world? Outreachy is for you! The term "free software" or "open
                    source" means that you have the freedom to use, copy, study, change, and improve a project. Examples
                    of open source projects include software like Linux or Firefox, documentation projects like
                    Wikipedia, or graphic design projects like OpenClipArt.org. If you're new to open source, we
                    encourage you to read an introductory article.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open source projects are built collaboratively. Open source contributors work together publicly.
                    Working publicly creates a fun collaborative community around a project. It allows anyone to make
                    innovative changes that reach many people.
                </p>
                <p>Open source contributors work on a lot of different things! You can contribute by developing software. Or you might want to improve user experience by contributing design work. You can help with documentation, community management, marketing, identifying issues and reporting bugs, helping users, event organization, graphic design, and translations.
                </p>
                <p>Sometimes people work on open source in their spare time. Many contributors are employed by companies and non-profit organizations to work on open source. That includes the companies that are sponsoring Outreachy!  Experience with open source is highly valuable in the professional world. Your contributions to open source provide a public portfolio for you. Employers can see your history of public collaboration, which will give them confidence when making hiring decisions.
                </p>

                <h5>
                    What is Outreachy?
                </h5>

                <p>
                    Outreachy is a paid, remote internship program. Outreachy's goal is to support people from groups underrepresented in tech. We help newcomers to free software and open source make their first contributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outreachy provides internships to work open source. People apply from all around the world. Interns work remotely, and are not required to move. Interns are paid a stipend of $7,000 USD for the three month internship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design, or data science. Interns often find employment after their internship with Outreachy sponsors or in jobs that use the skills they learned during their internship.
                </p>

                <h5>
                    Why Apply to Outreachy?
                </h5>

                <p>
                    Open source projects are built collaboratively. Open source contributors work together publicly.
                    Working publicly creates a fun collaborative community around a project. It allows anyone to make

                <h5>
                    How To Apply
                </h5>
                <p>
                    We're so excited to have you apply! The application process for Outreachy is longer than most internship applications, so we highly encourage applicants to start their application at least 2-3 weeks before the Outreachy application deadline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Make sure you're eligible to apply for Outreachy. We have strict eligibility rules for people who are students, so it's important that you confirm you're eligible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Pick 1-2 projects. Look at the proposed projects and pick 1-2 projects that look interesting to you. There will be more information on each community's landing page, including community chat channels and mentor contact information if you need to ask questions about the projects. You will need to complete the eligibility check and be eligible to apply in order to see project details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Make small, consistent contributions to the project(s) you've chosen. Each project will have a set of tasks for you to complete to see if you like working on the project. It's less important that you make a big, last minute contribution, and more important that you're in contact with the mentors, asking questions, and sending small contributions at a steady pace.  Only applicants that make at least one contribution, record that contribution on the Outreachy website, and submit a final application will be able eligible to be accepted as an intern. We find that the strongest applicants make multiple contributions throughout the application process, including after the application deadline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Record in-progress contributions on the Outreachy website. You'll need to go to the community landing page linked from the projects listing page. Then click the 'Record Contribution' button. Add links and descriptions to your contributions and the project timeline before the application deadline. You can always go back and edit your recorded contributions. A contribution doesn't have to be merged or accepted to be recorded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Complete your final application. You'll need to go to the community landing page linked from the projects listing page. Then click the 'Update Contributions and and Apply to This Project' button below the project you want to apply for. You will need to submit a final application to each project you've made a contribution to. The button to add the final application will only appear once you have recorded at least one contribution. Also, when applying for May internship rounds, check if there is an opportunity to apply for Google Summer of Code with the same project and complete an application for it as well.
