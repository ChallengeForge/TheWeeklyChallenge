**Below are the designs which have been created by using a Figma
designing tool.**

**Here is the link with which you can open it in Figma for editing, But
before editing make sure you go through this readme document.**

**This is the documentation which will help you to edit these badges and
logo for future use, later on I will be attaching some basic commands
which will be helpful to edit the current design. There are few points
to keep in mind while committing any edit to current design, always
create a copy of the current component let say the weekly challenge
badge , You should be creating a copy of the Design to work on so that
the current design cannot be lost. After creating the copy you can edit
the current design by basic Figma commands.**

**Figma Basic Commands Guide**

I have selected the design and that copy pasted it to create its
duplicate so that the current design won\'t get affected with my changes
.then I have selected the component whom I wanted to change its colour
you can change according to your colour palette, also there is an option
of colour picker to which can be used to pick any colour with the
current design, Just refer to the Figma YouTube link which I have
shared.

Thank you!!!

Happy Editing !!! :)
