**Below are the designs which have been created by using a Figma
designing tool.**

**Here is the link with which you can open it in Figma for editing, But
before editing make sure you go through this readme document.**

**This is the documentation which will help you to edit these badges and
logo for future use, later on I will be attaching some basic commands
which will be helpful to edit the current design. There are few points
to keep in mind while committing any edit to current design, always
create a copy of the current component let say the weekly challenge
badge , You should be creating a copy of the Design to work on so that
the current design cannot be lost. After creating the copy you can edit
the current design by basic Figma commands.**

**Figma Basic Commands Guide**

**1. Selection Tools:**

-   *Pointer (V):* Allows you to select and interact with objects on the
    canvas.

-   *Move (M):* Enables you to move selected objects around the canvas.

**2. Drawing Tools:**

-   *Shape (R):* Creates basic shapes such as rectangles, circles, and
    polygons.

-   *Pen (P):* Allows you to draw freeform shapes and paths.

-   *Text (T):* Inserts text boxes for adding text to your designs.

**3. Editing Tools:**

-   *Edit (Enter):* Enters into the edit mode for selected objects,
    enabling you to manipulate their properties.

-   *Scale (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K):* Resizes objects proportionally.

-   *Rotate (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R):* Rotates selected objects.

**4. Alignment and Distribution:**

-   *Align:* Aligns selected objects relative to each other (top,
    bottom, left, right, etc.).

-   *Distribute:* Distributes selected objects evenly with respect to
    their spacing.

**5. Layers Panel:**

-   *Arrange ((Cmd/Ctrl + [ ) or (Cmd/Ctrl +  ])):* Sends selected objects backward or
    forward in the layer hierarchy.

-   *Group (Cmd/Ctrl + G):* Groups selected objects together for easier
    manipulation.

-   *Component (Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + K):* Converts selected objects into
    reusable components.

**6. Prototyping:**

-   *Prototype (Cmd/Ctrl + Option/Alt + P):* Enables you to create
    interactive prototypes by linking frames.

-   *Interactions:* Define interactions between frames (click, hover,
    etc.) using the prototype panel.

**7. Collaboration:**

-   *Share (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + D):* Generates a shareable link to your
    Figma file.

-   *Comments:* Allows collaborators to leave comments on specific
    elements of the design.

**8. View Options:**

-   *Zoom (Cmd/Ctrl + + or -):* Zooms in or out of the canvas.

-   *Canvas Size:* Adjusts the canvas size according to your design
    requirements.

**9. Plugins:**

-   *Plugins Menu:* Access a variety of plugins to extend Figma\'s
    functionality, from design to collaboration tools.

**10. Version History:**

-   *Version History (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + H):* Tracks changes made to the
    design and allows for version comparison and restoration.

**Note:** Figma also provides extensive documentation and tutorials on
their website for further learning and exploration.

I have selected the design and that copy pasted it to create its
duplicate so that the current design won\'t get affected with my changes
.then I have selected the component whom I wanted to change its colour
you can change according to your colour palette, also there is an option
of colour picker to which can be used to pick any colour with the
current design, Just refer to the Figma YouTube link which I have
shared.

Thank you!!!

Happy Editing !!! :)
